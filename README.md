# MANCELONA IRONBOTS 4983

## This is the code for our 2024 FRC Crescendo Robot, Britney

We are specifically looking at using system identification and PathPlanner to have an incredibly robust autonomous period.

We have also standardized many components of our robot, specifically our motors and encoders to all be from Rev Robotics. This makes all of our code simpler and easier to read, and also makes working on the robot significantly easier.

Our CAD can be found on Onshape [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c73c3f11591549ff8238db58/w/1058dabfa17ace666ab44169/e/50e81b08c31f98b4e655e026?renderMode=0&uiState=65c2e1ba7106f705c396a8e9)

Additionally, we have used code from SciBorgs, team 1155, for use in dealing with spark max config inconsistency
