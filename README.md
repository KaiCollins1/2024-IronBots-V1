MANCELONA IRONBOTS 4983
This is the code for our 2024 FRC Crescendo Robot, [name tbd]

We are specifically looking at using system identification and PathPlanner to have an incredibly robust autonomous period.

We have also standardized many components of our robot, specifically our motors and encoders to all be from Rev Robotics. This makes all of our code simpler and easier to read, and also makes working on the robot significantly easier.
